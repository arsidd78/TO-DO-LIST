# TO-DO-LIST

This is my first project. In this project, I utilized my knowledge of Python by building a To-Do List application.

I used Tkinter for the GUI and SQLite3 as the database to store tasks. This is a basic application that I created to practice and showcase my Python skills. I plan to continue adding new features to it.

## CHALLENGES

While working on this project, I watched many tutorials and read documentation for Tkinter, SQLite, and Python.
However, I encountered several challenges while coding. Debugging the problems was particularly challenging for me, especially when multiple modules were integrated into the project.
As I added more features, debugging became even more difficult. Nevertheless, I successfully completed this project, and it taught me a lot more than any tutorial could have!
